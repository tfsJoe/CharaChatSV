Chara.Chat mod for Stardew Valley: change log

v1.0.1
* Farmer's own children can only speak from toddler age
* Improved acting for farmer's children
* Improved AI knowledge about player's family
* Fixed: Mod prevented farmer from hugging/kissing family. Convo will no longer open until after first one of the day.
* Fixed: Use display name instead of name in empty convo window. Some mods have weird base names for NPCs.
* Workaround: UI size tied to zoom level in unpredictable ways. Adjust zoom on open and close instead. Slight visual artifact.
* Add settings menu and ability to switch between budget and high quality AI setting.
